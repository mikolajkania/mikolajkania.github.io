I believe that sharing knowledge helps both writer & reader. It is also my contribution to the programming community. 

I am Mikołaj Kania, software developer & team leader living in Gdańsk, Poland. If you are interested in projects I do, conntact me via any social link I put on this page. 

I hope you will enjoy my blog. Cheers!
