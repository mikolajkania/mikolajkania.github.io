## Responding to market demand with generative AI releases

I had a unique opportunity to help expanding generative AI adoption within Wolters Kluwer portfolio with my technical and project management skills. This included:

Question-answering system and interactive chat with selected documents for [VitalLaw AI (USA)](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/solutions/vitallaw-law-firms/ai)

Summarization of jurisprudence for leading [legal research platform Lex (Poland)](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/pl-pl/news/wolters-kluwer-polska-dostarcza-nowe-narzedzia-specjalistom-pracujacym-z-interpretacjami-podatkowymi)

Further [improved summaries](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/news/wolters-kluwer-integrates-genai-into-its-legal-research-products) of legal documents for Wolters Kluwer Online (Germany)

As happy as I am with the delivered product features, I am proud of the teams I had a chance to work with. More outcomes will be visible in 2025, as the products are being rolled out to customers.
