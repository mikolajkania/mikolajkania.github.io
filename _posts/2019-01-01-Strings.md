Strings are a basic and the most frequently used data type in almost every programming language, but do you know that with a single command you can reduce their memory consumption by TODO%? And this is only one of many tricks you should be aware of.

## How Strings are built in Java?

### String are immutable objects

The heart of String object is char array which stores its content. String is wrapping it and prevents from changing, offering multiple methods returning new strings as a result of computation.   

{% highlight java %}
/** The value is used for character storage. */
private final char value[];
{% endhighlight %}

Why are Strings immutable? Security and thread-safety are the good answers, but in terms of performance we will be mostly interested in objects caching, implemented via **String pool**. Technically, it is a memory space located now on a Java heap. When you creates a new string variable with value already existing in the pool, JVM doesn't have to create another entry, and reference to existing object would be returned. It helps to reduce memory consumption of Java programs as Strings are very common objects in any application.  

Immutability and caching are also helpful when computing String's hash, as it can be saved after first call to hashcode method. It gives performance boost when using structures like HashMaps, where hashes are required to determine to which bucket object should be put. 

{% highlight java %}
public int hashCode() {
    int h = hash;
    if (h == 0 && value.length > 0) {
        hash = h = isLatin1() ? StringLatin1.hashCode(value)
                              : StringUTF16.hashCode(value);
    }
    return h;
}
{% endhighlight %}  

### Are Strings always returned from a pool?

No, they aren't, but the most convenient way of creating them - by string literal - works like that. Two strings literals from example below are not only equal in terms of value, but also share memory representation, pointing to one object in String pool. 

{% highlight java %}
String alice = "al" + "ice";
String bob = "alic" + "e";
System.out.println(alice.equals(bob));  // true
System.out.println(alice == bob);       // true
{% endhighlight %} 

There is another way of creating strings which involves calling its constructors. As a result, created objects will be separate entities with different memory representation on Java heap. If comes without saying that it is not advised way of dealing with strings in Java.

{% highlight java %}
String alice = new String("alice");
String bob = new String("alice");
System.out.println(alice.equals(bob));  // true
System.out.println(alice == bob);       // false
{% endhighlight %} 

You can manually place strings in their pool (or retrieve them if already exist) by calling String method intern().

{% highlight java %}
String alice = new String("alice");
String bob = new String("alice");
alice = alice.intern();
bob = bob.intern();
System.out.println(alice.equals(bob));  // true
System.out.println(alice == bob);       // true
{% endhighlight %} 

It is worth to mention that pool of literal values is not restricted to Strings. Other types in Java also supports this concept but in [a bit different way](https://stackoverflow.com/a/13098161).

### So, should we put all strings in a pool?

Now a question may come to your mind: shouldn't you intern all the strings of a (hello) world if it such a efficient idea? As always - it depends. 

Everything has a cost and also in case of pool JVM has to keep structure containing interned strings and search it. The longer the list, the slower it would be to found given objects. And if you sorted the strings in your application by number of occurrences, you would see that the biggest advantage of spring interning would be at the top of a list. At some point, the gain would be marginal or zero, but those entries still will be kept in pool. It is a wise idea to put developers in charge and let them decide how big their pool should be - and exactly that can be done with option *-XX:StringTableSize=n*. The default size now is, according to excellent [Java Performance: The Definitive Guide](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028499.do), 60 013.      

So when to increase the size of the pool? When you know that in your application you have many duplicated strings. 

### Use StringBuilder for string concatenation   

As String are immutable its concatenation requires creating a new entry after every change, which is not fast enough when there is many such operations or String class methods are involved. Java has an answer for that problem in a form of [class StringBuilder](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-jdk11/blob/999dbd4192d0f819cb5224f26e9e7fa75ca6f289/src/java.base/share/classes/java/lang/AbstractStringBuilder.java), not thread safe successor of StringBuffer.  

> Implements a modifiable string. At any point in time it contains some particular sequence of characters, but the length and content of the sequence can be changed through certain method calls.


It offers better performance during concatenation. Exact comparison can be seen in [this post](http://www.corejavaguru.com/effective-java/items/51). What's more, it helps avoid temporary Strings objects that would be a result of standard concatenation and offers additional methods to work on text.       

But should you always replace string concatenation with StringBuilder? In many situations it is the triumph of form over substance as you are loosing the readability of a code. What's more, compiler can do it for you under the hood when you are - for instance - explicitly adding few strings outside a loop. From [Java Language Specification](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se11/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.18.1):    

> 'To increase the performance of repeated string concatenation, a Java compiler may use the StringBuffer class or a similar technique to reduce the number of intermediate String objects that are created by evaluation of an expression.'     

The most important message from these section is that StringBuilder should be used always when many concatenations are performed, for example in a loop.
