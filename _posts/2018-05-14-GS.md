Working as a search engineer myself I decided to develop a framework for discovering optimal search settings for ElasticSearch and Solr. In this post I'll describe it and briefly discuss how the good process of building the quality of search should look like. Let's start!

**Problem to solve**

Imagine you are a search engineer or analyst whose responsibility is the quality of search. Consider an index of millions of documents, in which every one of them may have many searchable fields. When user types query your ranking system evaluates final score of a document taking into account all of those fields with different weights assigned. It's your job to figure out values, somehow.

**Why is it rocket science?**

With a help of the experts you were able to prepare a list of expected documents for given queries. In advanced systems such a list may easily consist of hundreds of entries. Now, imagine intuitively changing weight of one of those fields, running even the subset of queries manually and then guessing if the results are better... nightmare. You need a process.  

The first step would be running all queries with default settings and checking how the results deviates from expectations. You need a automatic system to perform at least the first part of a job. Hopefully, after deep analysis you can come up with patterns of errors and propose a solution. Then, the solution should be registered, applied and tested again. It should be done until results cannot be improved.

**Sounds easy? It isn't**

Every iteration takes time of at least one person who must run queries, analyze the results and come up with a solution. It is not guaranteed that every proposed idea would be helpful in the long run. What's more, at some point a mistake, that pushes whole process into wrong direction, can be added. Spotting the impending danger is extramely hard, as sometimes it requires taking a few steps back in thinking and discarding previous work. 

Another thing is necessity to automatically perform and view a summary of the results. It is crucial to quickly check promising ideas before applying them on greater scale. Building a human-friendly interface may be time-consuming and not necessarily effective as people with background in tech and analysis are looking into different features. But even in the ideal world testing & understanding of every change will take a lot of time and resources.
